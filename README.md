# ToyzHacks2025

Welcome to the ToyzHacks Repo! 

In there you have a sample scene from our game, the Showroom

It also has a default avatar too! with a basic script

The goal is to code your own superhero self along with your own powers and abilities

And to have it playable in our game!

To give guidance on restrictions,

Please look at this StarterAssets tutorial from Unity, 

When someone selects your avatar, they should have your avatar be able to be loaded in to a "Player" object similar to the one in their package

You can also look at this QuickStart From ReadyPlayerMe:
https://docs.readyplayer.me/ready-player-me/integration-guides/unity/quickstart

NOTE, it shows a quickstart to use your own avatar but it uses the *old* input system

Ours we have used to teach others was based on a mix between the two, Using Unity's new input system, which Unity's starter assets does.

Since we use the new input system, we strongly recommend in your script to to be able to add through the script to the Starter input actions system given by Unity so that your *script* is what would work easily into any default avatar using the new input system which is ready for both mobile and desktop
